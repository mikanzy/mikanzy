My name is **Mikhail** - *aka* Michael. After 10+ years of expirience at the National Metrological Research Institute, I decided to change my field of work to **Data Science**, Machine Learning and AI. 

I am attracted by the opportunity to use data to effectively solve actual practical problems. 


📚️ **My stack**:
- *Math*: Calculus, Linear algebra, Statistics
- *ML*: Classic ML, Time series forecasting, Neural Networks, NLP, Computer vision
- *Python*: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost, Optuna, SHAP, PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Transformers
- SQL (mainly PostgreSQL)
- *Environment*: VS Code, Jupyter, Conda, Git, Bash, Debian Linux
